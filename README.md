# MongoDB_Restaurant_Exercise

I have put some partial screenshots of the queries that I used for an exercise using MongoDB. I was not sure how to post some sort of proof about what I did, so I just used some screenshots.

Credit for the data set goes to Michal Bogacz. I got the data set here: https://www.kaggle.com/michau96/restaurant-business-rankings-2020
